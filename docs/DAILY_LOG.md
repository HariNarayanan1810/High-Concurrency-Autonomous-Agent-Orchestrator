# Daily Log

## 2026-10-26 CI Follow-up

- User pushed core commit 28cae77 and merged PR #3; screenshots show remote Java build success but hook step failure after all 9 checks passed.
- Reproduced the failure locally using GitHub's PowerShell wrapper. The last expected negative hook test leaves LASTEXITCODE=1. The earlier shell-edition adjustment did not solve exit-status propagation.
- Added explicit success exit after assertions/finally cleanup in scripts/Test-GitHooks.ps1. All 9 checks plus the exact wrapper pass in isolated and active projects with exit 0. A deliberately injected isolated error still exited 1; removed injection.
- Created fix/hook-test-exit-status from the clean core commit; no Java/teammate code or hook validation policy changes. Updated progress/test evidence. No assistant commit, push, or merge.
- Next: user reviews/signs/pushes this focused fix, opens a PR into main, and verifies a fresh GitHub run. Remote success is not claimed from local reproduction.

## 2026-10-26

Work performed (actual date; no backdating):

- Confirmed active C:\IMP project and published main bc25f93; no newer teammate main change was found. Created feature/core-orchestration and removed an accidental `de` token from HealthControllerTest.
- Implemented owned orchestration through existing ports: discovery snapshots/candidate validation, fan-out, asynchronous aggregation, task/agent correlation, output limits, sanitized failures, deadline, cancellation, shutdown, and late-completion guards.
- Added RUNNING/SUCCEEDED/FAILED states, terminal result API and HTTP 409 behavior; preserved submission/status APIs. Added admission-driven terminal retention cleanup and validated execution configuration.
- Default execution remains disabled until approved AgentDirectory/AgentClient/TaskExecutionEngine beans exist. No production agent/executor/Redis substitute or teammate source rewrite was made.
- TaskEvent now emits schema v2 with backward validation of v1 QUEUED/CANCELLED; consumer compatibility is a Navitha/team handoff, not assumed accepted.
- Added explicitly test-only execution/agent fixtures, 20 orchestration tests, 8 real HTTP execution tests, and focused properties/retention/schema tests. Full isolated clean verify passed 71 tests, zero failures/errors/skips, packaged JAR.
- Aligned CI's hook step with locally tested Windows PowerShell. No remote-green claim until a new run.
- Updated README, architecture, contracts, requirements, planning/ownership clarification, progress, core handoff, test report and historical Week 1/Git audit context. Overall member ownership is not an official per-member weekly schedule.

Files: core/{Task,TaskStatus,TaskService,OrchestrationService,TaskFailure,TaskConflictException}; config/{OrchestrationProperties,OrchestrationConfiguration}; api/{TaskController,ApiExceptionHandler,dto/TaskResultResponse}; integration/TaskEvent; application.yml; focused test classes and support/TestExecutionEngine; backend-ci.yml; README/docs.

Final active-project verification: clean verify passed all 71 Java tests and packaged the JAR at 19:45:37 IST; all 9 Git-hook checks passed; packaged-JAR smoke verified health, queued submission, pending-result 409 and cancellation/result on localhost port 58683. Temporary Java process stopped. See TEST_REPORT.md.

Remaining: user review/commit/push/PR; agree real adapter delivery dates, integrate/test approved teammate implementations; assign still-unowned project deliverables. No commit, push, merge, remote setting, private-key access, or backdated activity was performed.

## 2026-10-13

Work Performed:

- Created Agent and Agent Registry java files
- Organized the file structure
- This Agent Registry file is used to interact with the core orchestrator and manage the virtual thread registration

Remaining work:

- Test the Agent files. Hope it will be completed by tomorrow 14-10-2026

## 2026-10-15

Work performed:

- Verified active C:\IMP project on fix/application-startup at Ahamed's ab0eff8. OneDrive folder is a separate older copy.
- Reviewed his commit; full startup failed despite the MVC test passing. GitHub reported no associated PR and an unsigned commit.
- Preserved Agent.java/AgentRegistry.java. Removed duplicate controller/HealthController.java and corrected the health test import.
- Added task submission/status/cancellation, immutable snapshots, UTC timestamps, validation, and centralized problem responses.
- Added configurable bounded storage; no execution, persistence, or distributed integration is claimed.
- Proposed discovery/client/execution Java ports and documented Redis dependencies and a simulated-agent test MVP.
- Updated architecture, contracts, requirements, plan, ownership, progress, and tests. No work or commits were backdated.

Tests executed:

- mvn -B -ntp verify: BUILD SUCCESS; 19 tests, zero failures/errors/skips; executable JAR packaged in the isolated copy.
- Real HTTP tests cover full startup, health, submission/read/cancel, validation, malformed JSON/UUID, 404, and storage capacity 503.
- Functional concurrency check: 60 attempts on 8 test threads, exactly 10 accepted with capacity 10; not a connection benchmark.
- Active-project verification: mvn -B -ntp clean verify -Ddebug=false -Dlogging.level.org.springframework=INFO; BUILD SUCCESS at 15:24 IST, 19 tests, zero failures/errors/skips. Packaged JAR built in C:\IMP project.
- Packaged-JAR smoke test on temporary localhost port 62579: health UP, submitted/retrieved QUEUED, cancelled CANCELLED. Temporary process stopped.
- First active-project verification had 10 context errors because the controller deletion was omitted during patch transfer; applied that deletion, then clean verification passed. No unresolved build failure remains.

Remaining work:

- Review uncommitted active-project changes and configure signing before user-controlled commits/PR. No commit, push, merge, or remote change performed.
- Dispatch, execution lifecycle, results/aggregation, and approved teammate integration.
- Week 3/4 work remains UNASSIGNED until the lead decides ownership.

## 2026-10-17

- Implemented `InMemoryAgentRegistry in the domain package.
- Registration is idempotent by agent name: registering the same name returns the existing agent.
- Used a `ReentrantLock` to guard the id and name indexes together. I chose it over
  `synchronized` so virtual threads are never pinned.
- Heartbeats are lock-free and cannot resurrect a removed agent.
- Wrote `InMemoryAgentRegistryTest` with 12 tests, including concurrency tests on virtual
  threads (5,000 same-name registrations produce one agent; 16 threads of
  register/heartbeat/remove churn never fail).

**Results**
- `./mvnw test`: [8 passed, 0 failed]

**Problems and fixes**
- My first draft used `computeIfAbsent` over two maps. A concurrent remove and register
  could return null for a name that was mid-removal. Fixed with a lock around both
  indexes and added a churn test to guard against regression.

## 2026-10-18

Work performed (HARI's Week 1 completion work):

- Verified PR #1 merged and SSH signing configured locally. GitHub API reported 13a2e75 unknown_key and zero signing keys for HariNarayanan1810; user was unsure how to confirm the registration. No private key was read or regenerated.
- GitHub main was unprotected at audit. Supplied concrete setup instructions rather than claiming server enforcement.
- Reviewed latest main 3eca18d and ran all tests: 31 passed, including Ahamed's 12 registry tests. Fast-forwarded the clean active local main to this reviewed commit and created feature/week1-foundation.
- Preserved Ahamed's production/test files. His historical October 17 test command/count and pinning claims above are not rewritten: this session independently verified 12 functional tests, not absence of thread pinning. No Maven wrapper exists yet; actual command used is mvn.
- Defined core Redis lease/event interfaces and versioned payload-free task event schema, with validation/JSON contract tests. No Redis production module was implemented.
- Verified a real HTTP request runs on a virtual thread using test-only instrumentation. No Robin production engine was implemented.
- Removed the hardcoded build-version bean; health uses Maven-generated build-info.
- Added versioned Git hooks, repository-local installer, disposable hook tests, PR template, and read-only CI workflow with official action commit pins.
- Updated integration handoff, Git workflow, ownership, architecture, acceptance matrix, plan, and progress.

Tests executed:

- Baseline mvn -B -ntp clean verify: 31 passed.
- Updated isolated mvn -B -ntp clean verify -Ddebug=false -Dlogging.level.org.springframework=INFO: 36 passed, zero failures/errors/skips; executable JAR packaged.
- powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/Test-GitHooks.ps1: 9 checks passed. Temporary fixture identities/keys were removed; no actual repository commit or network push was made.
- Active C:\IMP verification: same clean Maven command passed all 36 tests, 0 failures/errors/skips; executable JAR packaged. Installed repository-local core.hooksPath=.githooks; reran all 9 hook checks successfully in the active project.

Remaining work:

- Review uncommitted feature/week1-foundation changes and resolve the external signing/main-protection steps before claiming full Week 1 acceptance.
- GitHub account public-key registration/verification, protected main and remote CI evidence remain IN PROGRESS. User-controlled signed commit/PR is still needed.
- Secure registration/communication, production concurrency engine, and Redis adapters remain with their owners; Week 3/4 unassigned work remains unassigned.
